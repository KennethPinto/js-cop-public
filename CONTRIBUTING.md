# CONTRIBUTING GUIDE

A public repository is public in the sense that anyone can read it, and clone it and play around with it, but not write to it. You can write to it only if you have write access.

Neverthless, contributing to a public repository is easy. All you have to do is fork the repository.

1. Fork the repository by going to the repository page and clicking on the `fork` button on the top right corner of the page. There you could choose to fork it to your account.
2. Now you would a similar repo in your own github account, which you can clone locally and work with.
3. Push your changes to a remote branch in your repository.
4. Now you can create a PR in the original publiic repository from the branch you created in your forked repository.

More details on forking and syncing your repo with original repo can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
